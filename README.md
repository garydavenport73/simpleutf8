#
# A python script to generate ut-8 codeblock charts.
# It works reasonably well for its purpose.
# (tested in Python 3.8.6 64=bit)
#
# I mainly made this so I could inspect characters
# for video games/other uses by visually scanning through
# single condensed text file containing characters.
#
# if file is too large, you can change the numbers 
# in the range(2,4096) to different starting/ending numbers.
# it opens ok for me in notepad, but the output file is 
# 299kb and 5120 lines long.
# 
# input-none
# output-a text file containing tables of utf-8 characters
#
# output can be checked against website
